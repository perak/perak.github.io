#### Meteor Kitchen

Started [Meteor Kitchen](http://www.meteorkitchen.com) project in 2014. "Meteor Kitchen" is a code generator for Meteor.js that dramatically speeds up and simplifies development of web and mobile applications. A year later, together with growing number of users (developers), "Kitchen" is moving closer and closer to a great dream: **enable non-experts to build great, modern and reactive web & mobile applications** in minutes instead of hours. Or in hours instead of days.
